Used Slave Auction
These slaves have been trained to varying degrees by their former masters, but discarded, usually to make room for new stock. Slaves from here have been heavily used, and will run on the older side.

Raider's Union
A boisterous auction by pirates who opportunistically hit small colonies. Slaves from here will be disobedient, and not as scared of you as they were of their former captors. Given the brutality of the raiders, it's safe to assume that none will be virgins, though they are cheap.

Prisoner Auction
A pseudo-governmental affair, the prisoner auction started as a way for small colonies to pay others to host their incarcerated. Over time, capitalism mutated it into its current form. Slaves from here will be mostly-young hardened criminals, and will require significant training.

The Juvie Corporation
Raiders often kidnap slaves that are too young to sell. The Juvie corporation buys them for cheap and keeps them alive until they are. Slaves from the Juvie corporation will mostly be virgins, and will be slightly more obedient than raided slaves due to their confinement.

Breeder's Show
An everlasting parade run by professional slave breeders. Slaves from here will have been bred for servitude, trained from a young age, and sold as soon as they reached their majority. They are expensive, but they're guaranteed virgins, and extremely obedient.

The Pasture
A market set up to look like an open field. Its sells only slaves that have been modified for permanent lactation. They're guaranteed to be immediately productive in any dairy, but they're completely untrained for sexual services.

Bigger and Better
A niche market that force-feeds its slaves until they reach large sizes. Their specialty nature makes them expensive, though most slavemasters would ignore them completely.

Sunset Farms
The inevitable fate of any slave lucky (or unlucky) enough to reach old age. Most will never be bought, but they are listed at deep discounts, and the price occasionally dips low enough to attract food manufacturers.
