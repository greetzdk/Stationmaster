Do you like this body? I'm still getting used to it. My last one was a bit taller.
I love getting new bodies. They develop all sorts of little aches and pains.
It also saves me from having to trade with that insufferable bitch Micah, and I get a little variety in my life. Everyone wins.
Except for the slave, of course, but that just adds to the fun. 
That look they give you when they realize what the surgery is for? Delicious.






As you walk into Fei's room, you see that she has gotten started without you. Several slaves are tied to beds around the room, and she is brandishing a knife over one of the bound girls.


I like you. Really, I do. Unfortunately, you're in my way. Conquering worlds like it's going out of style. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to watch you dominate all of those little lords, but the balance of power can only take so much upheaval. Instability is bad for business, and your little market floods are starting to cut into my margins. 
I think we both knew this was coming, sooner or later. Don't worry. I intend to keep you alive. You won't be in charge of anything, of course, but you might still enjoy yourself, if you try.
