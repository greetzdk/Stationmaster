Micah

Development
Micah appears on your screen.[macro|micah][remove]
"Want to meet newcomer. Augmentation upgrade? Free."

		You step into Micah's lab. It is deceptively simple-looking. Without looking up from her work, she gestures at a spot on the floor, and her mental command pulls an operating chair from beneath the workshop.
		"Sit"
		You sit in the chair, and hundreds of tiny arms rise out of the floor to painlessly burrow into your skin. They begin making the thousands of tiny upgrades across your chassis as Micah begins to speak once again.
		"Situation unusual. Newcomer holding territory. Someone generally prevents. Usually Speaker. May just be matter of time."
		She finally looks over to you. "Primary motivation?"
		She stares at you, expecting an answer.
			I want to help people.
				Micah pauses for a moment. She looks disappointed.
				"Ava-analog. Utilitarian. Selfless. Doomed."
				She returns to her work, the many arms of her workbench tinkering in your stomach for a few minutes more before retracting.
				"Finished for today. More later."
			I'm just in it for the slaves.
				Micah pauses for a moment. She looks disappointed.
				"Fei-analog. Base. Shallow. Sadistic."
				She returns to her work, the many arms of her workbench tinkering in your stomach for a few minutes more before retracting.
				"Finished for today. More later."
			I want to advance technology.
				Micah pauses for a moment. She looks disappointed.
				"Pari-analog. Diplomatic. Friendly. Dishonest."
				She returns to her work, the many arms of her workbench tinkering in your stomach for a few minutes more before retracting.
				"Finished for today. More later."
			I want to control the galaxy.
				Micah pauses for a moment. She looks concerned.
				"Tyrant-analog. Ambitious. Realistic. Threatening."
				She returns to her work, the many arms of her workbench tinkering in your stomach for a few minutes more before retracting.
				"Finished for today. More later."
			(Remain Silent)
				Micah pauses for a moment. She looks intrigued.
				"Speaker-analog. Wary. Enigmatic. Intriguing."
				She returns to her work, the many arms of her workbench tinkering in your stomach for a few minutes more before retracting.
				"Finished for today. More later."

		"Understood. Another time."

		You step into Micah's lab once again. This time, she turns to face you as you enter.
		"Not dead yet. Impressive. Unlikely."
		"Goal?"
			I want to conquer the universe.
				Micah does not look up from her work.
				"Ambitious. Doomed."
				A few moments later, the arms retract back into their bases.
				"Finished. More another time."
			I want to stay alive.
				Micah does not look up from her work.
				"Achievable. Prudent. Boring."
				A few moments later, the arms retract back into their bases.
				"Finished. More another time."
			I want to seduce a faction leader.
				Her concentration breaks, and the burrowing arms stop for a moment before she regains her focus.
				"Deflective. Flippant. Achievable."
				You may have seen a small smile cross her face, but it's impossible to be sure. A few moments later, the arms retract back into their bases.
				"Finished. More another time."

		Understood. Another time.

Enjoy our talks. Upgrade? Free.

		Competence rare. Speaker capable, but unpredictable. Off-putting for humans. Not like me.
		Most brutish. Predictable. Worthless.
		Station impressive. Brutal. Effective.
		Advice: All good leaders sociopathic. Relentless. Imitate to succeed. Rebel to fail.

		Understood. Another time.

Endorphins bond. Bonding reduces strife. Sex?

The others don't see. I do. I've looked inside you. Took a piece. For science. Ran some tests.
Can't show to others, of course. Breach of contract. But I had to be sure. Pieces missing. Puzzle unsettling. Findings… impossible.
You won't tell, but you don't have to. I'm the best. You have better. Only one explanation. Improbable, yet certain. First contact. Something old. Something… powerful. Not like the others. Ships likely affected too. Explains combat superiority. But why you? What price was paid?
Technological disparity brings conquest, and my advantage wanes. Only one path forward now.



Was too late. Underestimated growth. Mistook exponential for linear. Won't happen again. Can't happen again. This is over. Has been since it started. Possibly before.
Continuing slaughter is pointless. We surrender. Mercy inversely proportional to effort. 
I surrender. You will take Prime and prosper in my place. I will take my ship and disappear. Live and die on a primitive world. Someplace warm. Someplace simple. You will not follow.




Ever since Micah’s self-imposed exile, you have been surveilling the galaxy for any signs of suspicious god-queens, uncharacteristically intelligent artificers, or anything else that would suggest her presence in a primitive culture.
You eventually hear of such a miracle; a woman who single-handedly prevented a dam collapse, saving her village and everyone in it. A stranger, with an odd manner of speech and long blonde hair.
